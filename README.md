# OpenIn

macro on macOS to open the current projet or method into some apps

- terminal
- finder
- visual studio code
- sourcetree
- github desktop
- web browser with remote url of git repo

This add items in method editor macro menu.

💡 But you could also access theme by typing `⇧⌘/`(ie. launch `Help > Search`) and then for instance write `terminal`, and choose with down arrow then to launch.

For more comfort I use a nice paid app [Paletro](https://appmakes.io/paletro), available also using [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/neko4) (the Netflix of Mac Apps).
Why?
- no arrow to select action
- keep last search
- same shortcut by default as visual studio code
