# OpenIn

- terminal
- finder

This add items in method editor macro menu.

ðŸ’¡ But you could also access them by typing `â‡§âŒ˜/`(ie. launch `Help > Search`) and then for instance write `terminal`, and choose with down arrow the action to launch.

ðŸ›‹ For more comfort, I use a nice paid app [Paletro](https://appmakes.io/paletro), available also using [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/neko4) (the Netflix of Mac Apps).

Why?
- no arrow to select action
- keep last search
- same shortcut by default as visual studio code
